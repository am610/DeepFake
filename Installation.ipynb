    " ### Using Python Notebook \n",
    " We have created a python [notebook: Sentinet-II-Video_Check.ipynb](https://github.com/am610/DeepFake/blob/main/Sentinel_II_Video_Check.ipynb), which can be run from online cloud platform like [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). Our trained model is already loaded in the notebook. \n",

    " Users can simply input videos in the respective cell with proper links. To check a video from the already present pool of videos we have, a google drive link of the correspondng folder is provided. Users should copy the folder to their own google drive and edit the path in the notebook to be able to load videos from the mounted google drive. On succesfull loading of a video, whose path looks something like this, \n",
